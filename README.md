# IDENTITY_CARD_GENERATOR
created using Swing and AWT frameworks of JAVA 

This Java application generates Identify Card for student, where student module has created in which student first have to fill their details.
Then, we have Admin Module where admin will login first and then will redirect to one page where admin has to enter student roll number as username and password.
Now the entered roll number will get match to the database's student roll_number...if roll_number get matches it will fetch all the details and generates the Identity_Card.

NOTE: The Database needs to be created in case you are going to make use of this project. :)
